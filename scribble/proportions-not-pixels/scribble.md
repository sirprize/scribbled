Let's start off by setting our base type size to the browserâ€™s default, which in most cases is 16 pixels. We can then use ems to size text up or down from that relative baseline. The formula to do so is **target-size / context-size = em's**.

Assuming that our base font-size of 100% on the body element equates to 16px and we would like to have a target size reflecting 24px in proportion, we can plug our desired values directly into our formula: **24px / 16px = 1.5em**
